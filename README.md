This project is to stop the burglary in trains.
It is a bluetooth  based system enabling the user to keep track of his/her luggage if someone tries to move it away from us without their knowing.
The project allows the traveller to access their luggage with voice commands only, with this any attempt without the spell of pincode will trigger the buzzer and will aware the passenger about the mishappenings.
